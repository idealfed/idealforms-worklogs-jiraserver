JIRA Worklogs
Ideal Federal Technologies LLC


This repository contains an Atlassian JIRA plugin that provides worklog forms for use within the JIRA system.


Please see the ideal forms site for details:  http://wwww.idealforms.com


The plugin runs as a servlet on the JIRA Tomcat instance and the plugin uses the JIRA API for its interaction.

The worklog reports are built using Ideal Forms configuration and management works similarly to Microsoft Access "Forms".  The concept is the JIRA Project becomes the datastore and data model and one uses the EXTJS forms to create custom user interfaces.

Using this package you can effectively customize most any workflow automation.


We continue to work on documentation for the plugin.  Please feel free to contact Ideal Federal Technologies LLC with questions.



#Installation

To use please install from the Atlassian Marketplace from within your JIRA system.

To compile and alter or branch:  You need to set up an Atlassian development environment with the Atlassian SDK.  This is not hard and once done you should be able to:  "atlas-package" this project.
